        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>&ensp;Soon after its release (March 2020), Animal Crossing: New Horizons became a worldwide hit. Cute characters, ambient environments and innocent minigames have made this Nintendo Switch game so massively successful. Players can meet new friends, go on adventures and visit the virtual ‘islands’ of other players. So, you might ask, why would the Chinese government ever have to ban such a kid-friendly game?

            <h2>Protesting in a virtual world</h2>
            <p>&ensp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_games_in_China" target="_Blank">Under Chinese law</a>, the government may forbid any games threatening China’s national prestige or unity ~ and <i>Animal Crossing</i> was able to do just that:<br><br>

                Whereas players of the game are meant to socially interact over escapist and imaginary things, the virtual gatherings became all too real when Hongkongers used the platform to continue their demonstrations against China’s government.
                </p><br>
                <h2> The Hong Kong protests</h2>
            <p>&ensp;In 2019, Hong Kong’s streets turned black as huge crowds started protesting against the Chinese government. A quick refresher as to why these demonstrations broke out:<br><br>

            Hong Kong conjoined mainland China in 1997 under the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_country,_two_systems" target="_Blank">‘one country, two systems’ </a>condition; the city could retain its liberal system of governance. Since Hongkongers are rather fond of this system, they were furious when their local government sought to implement <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-controversial-about-Basic-Law-Article-23-of-Hong-Kong?share=1" target="_Blank">article 23’</a>. To the protesters, article 23 confirmed their suspicions that China’s national government sought to assimilate — and absorb — Hong Kong.</p>
        <br><h2>‘Creative’ mini-games</h2>
        <p>&ensp;When the Corona pandemic swept across the world, Hongkongers had to seize their demonstrations. But, not long after Animal Crossing’s launch (March 20) Hongkongers thought of continuing their protests in-game. On social media, people shared videos and screenshots with their in-game characters bashing the heads of public figures such as Carrie Lam ~ the chief executive of Hong Kong. So, it’s easy to wonder why mainland China wasn’t all that happy about this game.
        <br><br>~ That is how an innocent game caused so much unrest.
