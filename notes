Pitch for revamp

Make a documentary video of a couple minutes with an article under 
-> that is a new style of article writing that people may enjoy




__SEO optimizing
Try to make the google appearance better (the snippet and so on)
Try to do an seo audit of the website (if there are any online)

prioritize the articles in the sitemap hierarchy
-> do research if the index page should rank high 

Try to find ways to cooperate with other websites
-> if you join clubs like online historians you might be able to get a friend with a nice big website. 
... you can put a no index on the themehomes perhaps that is a great technique && perahaps add a canonical link to them.

Try to have better in-site links
-> at the end of articles try to have 3 images with links to other articles 


_UI optimizing
Maybe i should have some images on the side of pages like in marzia's midle ages article 
-> that is so beautiful

__Socmed strat 
Create solid books
