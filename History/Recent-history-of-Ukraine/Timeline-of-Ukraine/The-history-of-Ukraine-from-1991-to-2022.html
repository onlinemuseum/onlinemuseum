    On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraïne. Events surrounding the crisis are still unfolding. In this article, I have made an attempt to assemble - global and national - events that stand in relation to the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. That is to say, the article includes some of my personal value assesments when it comes to the backround of the current conflict in Ukraine. The timeline stops at the start of 2022, because its purpose is to lay out the related history of the current situation; it is by no means a news report of ongoing events.

<h2></h2>
<b>1991</b> The Soviet Union dissolves. Ukraine declares independence (as many other former Soviet regions do). A vote shows that 92.3% of all its citizens are in favor of this Declaration of Independence.
<br><br>
<b>1990s</b> Ukraine suffers <a href="https://www.worldeconomics.com/GrossDomesticProduct/Ukraine.gdp">economic hardships</a>.
<br><br>
<b>2004</b> Pro-Russian kandidate Viktor Yanukovich is elected president. The election is officially renunciated by the European Union and other Western powers such as Canada and the United States. 
<br><br>

<b>2004</b> Parts of Ukraine's own population suppose that the 2004 election suffered from election fraud en quite strong propaganda attempts. These suspicions are so widespread that a massive demonstration known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Revolution">Orange Revolution</a> erupts after the elections concluded. These demonstrations take place over a time-span of several months. 
<br><br>

<b>2004-5</b> Because of the Orange Revolution, re-elections are held. The result of these elections is that pro-Western kandidate Yuschenko replaces Yanukovich as president.
<br><br>

<b>2008</b> The Russo-Georgian occurs. This war makes Russia realise that its army underperforms quite severaly. As a result, it commences thorough reforms of its armed forces. Moreover, Russia's defense budget <a href="https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/RUS/russia/military-spending-defense-budget">increases slightly</a>.
<br><br>

<b>2008</b> NATO promises that Ukraine will be welcomed into its alliance one day.
<br><br>

<b>2010</b> Yanukovich (the pro-Russian president who abdicated in 2005) is elected as president. Several international inquiries suggest that the 2010 elections did not include significant election fraud nor propganda attempts; it is generally accepted that these elections were rather fair. 
<br><br>
<b>2010</b> Yanukovich makes a deal with Russia. Russia will reduce the price of its natural gas by 30% for Ukraine. In exchange, Ukraine extends its lease of Russia's naval base in Sevastopol with 25 years (the lease would otherwise have ended in 2017). Some may might regard this deal as a conclusion of sorts to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia–Ukraine_gas_disputes">many intense discussions</a> between Ukrainian and Russia about gas and pipeline infrastructure. It is such a big deal in international relations between these countries, because <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090114195332/http://www.twq.com/09winter/docs/09jan_ChowElkind.pdf">80% of oil and gas</a> that went from Russia to Europe transitted through Ukraine in 2009. In later years, Russia made succesful attempts to reduce this infrastructural dependency on Ukraine. According to ABC News Nord Stream 2 would be <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-02-23/us-russia-ukraine-sanctions-what-happens-next/100842010">"just the final nail in the coffin of Ukraine no longer being an important transit quarter"</a>
<br><br>

<b>2013</b> Yanukovich declares that he will stop talks with regard to a European Union Association Agreement. It is seen as a symbolic break with the EU and NATO.
<br><br>

<b>2013-14</b> Heavy protests break out because of this 'break with Europe' that Yanukovich exhibited. This Euromaiden protest lasts from November 2013 - February 2014. More than 100 people died because of clashes. 
<br><br>

<b>2014</b> The Ukrainian parliament votes unanimously for a resolution to the long-winding protest. Yanukovich is abdicated, political prisoners (such as former president Yulia Tymoshenko) are released, figures such as Viktor Pshonka (who had been the Prosectuor General of Ukraine from 2010) are relieved of their duties. 
<br><br>

<b>2014</b> A few days after the abdication of Yanukovich, Russia invades Ukraine. He occupies the Crimean peninsula (hosting the important Russian naval base in Sevastopol) and commences fights in Eastern Ukraine. 
<br><br>

<b>2014</b> The MH17 incident takes place: alleged Russian soldiers shot down a commercial airplane with a BUK missile.
<br><br>
<b>2014</b> It takes 'the West' multiple months to come up with sanctions in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. During these sanctions, Russia realizes that it is too dependent on the US dollar. This realization triggers financial reforms. A clear example of the attmept to restructure Russia's economy is the build up of gold and non-Western currency reserves. Russia moreover seeks to become more autarkic and looks towards establishing trade deals with Asia. 
<br><br>
<b>2014-15</b> The Minsk I and II agreements are signed. They are supposed to de-escalate the current frictions and agree upon a status quo. 
<br><br>
<b>2014-present</b> China amplifies its military presence in the South China Sea. It erects military bases on islands and showcases increasingly more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luTPMHC7zHY">provocative</a> behaviour. 
<br><br>
<b>2015</b> The ISIS Caliphate reaches its peak. NATO succeeds in pushing them back.
<br><br>
<b>2017</b> Ukraine and the EU sign the "European Union Association Agreement". This concerns the agreement that Yanukovich called off in 2013. 
<br><br>
<b>2017-present</b> The United States <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-usa-syria-idUSKBN1A42KC">retreat</a> from Syria. This is seen as a Russian victory because Assad's regime was backed by Putin. As a thanks to Russia's support, Assad allows Russia to maintain a naval base in Syria.  
<br><br>
<b>2019</b> The pro-Western Zelenskyy beats Poroshenko in the presidential elections.
<br><br>
<b>2019-20</b> Huge protests occur in Hong Kong because people believe mainland China encroaches upon the citizens' rights. 
<br><br>
<b>2020</b> Putin's political opponent Navalny is poisoned with a Novichock venom. However, he survives. Russia denies responsibility. 
<br><br>
<b>Early 2020</b> The Covid-19 virus instigates a Pandemic 
<br><br>
<b>2020-21</b> The European Union reaches an agreement about a huge economic stimulus fund, which facilitates countries to lend far more than usual. The ECB is criticized for its lackluster approach to inflation and even <a href="https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/economie/beurs/artikel/5107726/banken-krijgen-nog-meer-geld-toe-als-ze-lenen-bij-de-ecb-lagarde">facilitates</a> the climate of cheap loans. Faced with high numbers of inflation the ECB eventually conducts counter-measures to the financial issues in the European Union. Other countries such as the USA are also faced with high numbers of inflation and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNNUVEfoNmE&t=1084s">react accordingly</a>.
<br><br>
<b>2021</b> An increased number of protests break out in many different countries across the globe. It showcases polarization and a decreased believe in the proper functioning of national governments.
<br><br>
<b>2021</b> The Afghanistan evacuation occurs. The USA leaves behind billions of dollars worth of material. The evacuation of Afghanistan is seen as a Western defeat and a mark of governmental mismanagement. It also retriggers the question: should NATO and the US retain their image of an international peacekeeping entity. In other words, should it wage war in countries far from home? 
<br><br>
<b>March 2021</b> Russia commences large-scale military exercises around the Ukrainian border. 
<br><br>
<b>7 December 2021</b> Biden warns Russia that huge sanctions will follow if it decides to invade Ukraine.
<br><br>
<b>17 December 2021</b> Rusland <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/dec/17/russia-issues-list-demands-tensions-europe-ukraine-NATO">announces</a> a series of conditions for the de-escalation of frictions in Europe. 
<br><br>
<b>4 January 2022</b> Cyberattack on websites of the Ukrainian government. The message 'Be Afraid and Expect the Worst' is shown in different languages on these websites.  
<br><br>
<b>End of timeline</b> This is not a timeline of current-affairs, but an attempt to provide some background knowledge of the ongoing Ukraine conflict.
