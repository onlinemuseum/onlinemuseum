<!--https://www.britannica.com/list/11-egyptian-gods-and-goddesses
  Seth 
  ptah
  
  Osiris - god of the underworld (death, resurrection, cycle of nile floods)
  He was a king of egypt who was cut into pieces by his brother Seth.
  His wife Isis put him back together and produced their child Horus.
  
  Isis - One could call her the caring mother of Egypt: 
  she cared for mortals even after they died. 
  That is why you will see her in many tombs; she could care for the deceased.

  Horus - The son of Isis and Osiris and the symbol for divine rule. 
  He is most often portrayed as a falcon and represents war as well as hunting.
  Most pharaos made a claim of descendancy from this God. 
  Some even said they are manifestations of the god

  Seth - god of chaos, plagues and storms. 
  He is depicted with a doglike body, but scholars are not quite sure which animal he really represents. 

  Ra - The god Ra or Re is easily noticed on Egyptian iconography: he usually has the head of a hawk and the sun over his head.
  He permanently sailed across the sky on his boat - giving light to the living during the day and shedding light on the underworld at night.
  Ra and Horus are quite alike and were fused together in late Ancient Egypt. 

  Amon - Many Egyptian gods have an origin city, and Amon's is the historic city of <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Thebes_(Egypt)/">Thebes</a>. 
  He could be depicted as a Ram or a Goose, but he simply wore a crown quite often too. 
  At some point in Egypt's history Amon was merged with the sun-god Ra. 
  The temple of Amon-Ra is a testimony of this fusion.

  Hathor - The goddess Hathor was the daughter of Horus, and like her father she is a 'god of the sky'.
  She is most often represented with cows or elements of a cow. (like you see on the image below) 
  It was sometimes said that Hathor is the literal and figurative 'golden eye of Horus': she not only replaced the eye after Seth cut it of, but she was also her father's most prized posession.
  That is to say, she caught 'the loving eye' of her father.
  The formation of this eye, or the birth of Hathor, is presented by the phases of the moon. 
  
  epithet: mistress of the sky 
  Rites of passage

  Anubis 
  Before Osiris became god of the underworld, Anubis had reigned over these realms. 
  After the change of dynasties, Anubis occupied himself with funerary practices and the care for those who died.
  He became the prime deity for mummification in Egypt and is almost always portrayed as a jackal holding the <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Ankh/">key of life</a>.


  Thoth - Thoth is the Egyptian god of wisdom. 
  He is most often depicted as an ibis - a bird living close by the Nile. 
  With wisdom came skill insight; Thoth knew things even his fellow divinities did not know. 
  Thoth is particularly known for having invented language and the Egyptian script of hierogplyphs. 

  Bastet - Have you ever heard of Egyptians worshipping cats?
  It is a true fact - and many Egyptians owned or wore icons of this creature. 
  The goddess Bastet is the goddess who represents these felines.
  She is the daughter of Ra and represents fertility, happy life and parties. 
  In the earlier d
  
  female 
  head of lion or a cat 

  daughter of re

<h2>Bust of Cleopatra VII Philopator</h2>
<img id="ResponsiveImage" src="Bust_of_Cleopatra_VII_Philopator.jpg"> 
<p id="PicCaption">Cleopatra, the queen of Roman-ruled Egypt.</p>
<p>&ensp;&ensp;The bust was most likely found in the <a href=‚Äùhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antirhodos‚Äù>Sunken Palace of Cleopatra</a>, a small royal island close to Alexandria‚Äôs harbor. 
  This island, ‚ÄòAntirhodos‚Äô, is believed to have sunk in the 4th century CE after a series of earthquakes and tsunamis. 
  It submerged the palaces of Cleopatra and Marc Anthony - and beautiful artifacts like this one.
<p>&ensp;&ensp;
  The island was officially rediscovered in 1996, but busts like the one above may have been discovered and resurfaced much earlier than that.
  <p>&ensp;&ensp;You may enjoy watching this documentary about the underwater excavations around Antirhodos.

  If you want to view the bust for yourself, you have to visit the <a href="https://www.rom.on.ca/en">Royal Ontario Museum</a> (Canada).

  <a name="The-Headrest-of-Tutankhamun"></a> 
  <h2>Headrest of  Tutankhamun</h2>
  <img id="ResponsiveImage" src="headrest-of-Tutankhamun.jpg"> 
<p>&ensp;&ensp;
This ivory headrest was one of the many items found in the tomb of tutankhamun. 
The two lions represent East and West. 
They are also the typical companion animals of the God Shu, who is seen in the center. 
<p>&ensp;&ensp;Shu is the god of peace and the atmosphere between earth and universe 
He is also the great-grandfather of Tutankhamun (as Pharaohs claim to be either Horus or his son). 
But, the reason for Shu‚Äôs presence goes beyond that: 
  <p id="SideStory4">Headrests symbolize the sky. They hold up the head (the figurative sun).</p>
  <p>&ensp;&ensp;
...And that is the puzzlepiece we need to figure the meaning of this piece out: 
<ul>
<li>The lions point east and west, and rest on the soil. </li>
<li>Shu connects the sun with the soil. </li>
<li>The pharaoh‚Äôs head is a figurative sun, as he is a reincarnation of Horus (whose head bears the Sun). </li>


</ul>
<p>&ensp;&ensp;
If you want to know more, you may enjoy reading the established Egyptologist Bart Hellinckx, who wrote about <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/25152838?seq=1">the meaning of headrests</a>. 
You could also read the <a href="https://hdl.handle.net/21.12126/169652">Rijskmuseum der Oudheden's</a> insights on this exact piece (they kindly helped me out with writing this article).

  The Sphinx has a body of a lion and the head of a man. But, in Egyptian mythology we‚Äôre more used to the opposite (the body of a man and the head of an animal). Take Ra, Anubis and Thoth for instance:
