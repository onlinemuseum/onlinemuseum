<!--https://www.britannica.com/list/11-egyptian-gods-and-goddesses
  Seth 
  ptah
  
  Osiris - god of the underworld (death, resurrection, cycle of nile floods)
  He was a king of egypt who was cut into pieces by his brother Seth.
  His wife Isis put him back together and produced their child Horus.
  
  Isis - One could call her the caring mother of Egypt: 
  she cared for mortals even after they died. 
  That is why you will see her in many tombs; she could care for the deceased.

  Horus - The son of Isis and Osiris and the symbol for divine rule. 
  He is most often portrayed as a falcon and represents war as well as hunting.
  Most pharaos made a claim of descendancy from this God. 
  Some even said they are manifestations of the god

  Seth - god of chaos, plagues and storms. 
  He is depicted with a doglike body, but scholars are not quite sure which animal he really represents. 

  Ra - The god Ra or Re is easily noticed on Egyptian iconography: he usually has the head of a hawk and the sun over his head.
  He permanently sailed across the sky on his boat - giving light to the living during the day and shedding light on the underworld at night.
  Ra and Horus are quite alike and were fused together in late Ancient Egypt. 

  Amon - Many Egyptian gods have an origin city, and Amon's is the historic city of <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Thebes_(Egypt)/">Thebes</a>. 
  He could be depicted as a Ram or a Goose, but he simply wore a crown quite often too. 
  At some point in Egypt's history Amon was merged with the sun-god Ra. 
  The temple of Amon-Ra is a testimony of this fusion.

  Hathor - The goddess Hathor was the daughter of Horus, and like her father she is a 'god of the sky'.
  She is most often represented with cows or elements of a cow. (like you see on the image below) 
  It was sometimes said that Hathor is the literal and figurative 'golden eye of Horus': she not only replaced the eye after Seth cut it of, but she was also her father's most prized posession.
  That is to say, she caught 'the loving eye' of her father.
  The formation of this eye, or the birth of Hathor, is presented by the phases of the moon. 
  
  epithet: mistress of the sky 
  Rites of passage

  Thoth - Thoth is the Egyptian god of wisdom. 
  He is most often depicted as an ibis - a bird living close by the Nile. 
  With wisdom came skill insight; Thoth knew things even his fellow divinities did not know. 
  Thoth is particularly known for having invented language and the Egyptian script of hierogplyphs. 
  
  Anubis 
  Before Osiris became god of the underworld, Anubis had reigned over these realms. 
  After the change of dynasties, Anubis occupied himself with funerary practices and the care for those who died.
  He became the prime deity for mummification in Egypt and is almost always portrayed as a jackal holding the <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Ankh/">key of life</a>.

<img src="Ptolemy_before_Isis_Osiris.jpg">
<p id="PicCaption">The Egyptian gods found their way into Rome, once the Roman Empire came to be. 
Here Roman king Ptolemy introduces himself to the royal gods of Isis and Osiris - privilege only given to the Pharaoh of Egypt.
It is a prime example of <a href="">syncrety</a> (Egyptian-Roman fusion)

<a name="Bastet"></a> 
<h2>Bastet</h2>
<p>&ensp;&ensp;Perhaps you once heard that Ancient Egyptians worshipped cats. 
  The goddess Bastet is the one that these feline creatures represent. 
  She is a goddess of partying and having a good time. 
  In that sense, she is much alike the Greek god Dionysus and the Roman Bacchus.
  <br><br>&ensp;&ensp;
  But, upon contemplation, you may find that Roman, Greek ánd Egyptian god are very much alike. 
  Indeed, Bastet was even worshipped in Ancient Rome as a true goddess. 
  And some gods (like Isis or Syrapis) were very frequently fused in a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncretism">'syncretism'</a>.

<h2>Seth</h2>
<p>&ensp;&ensp;Seth was the god of chaos, plagues and storms. 
  He is depicted with a doglike body, but scholars are not quite sure which animal he really represents. 
  Seth is said to reign over the South of Egypt (known as 'Upper Egypt'), where the climate is more hostile and the land is less fertile.
