<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>&ensp;&ensp;



__The point of the article__
is to lay out the history of the rebellion and perhaps
showing why and how it was a predecessor of other revolts and perhaps even the protestant rebellions
__Layout__
First say that the 13th century was rather prosperous. 
Up until the black death there were some smaller plagues though, as well as a small ice age. 
However, the good chunk of population were alive and laboring - that meant that the land owners could demand a lot of their freedom and low wages. 
another event with strong implications for the peasant revolt and england was the 100 years war 
-> this made it so that they had to increase taxes at a certain point in time. 
In the 13th century several other phenomena occured: there was more urbanization
-> you could suggest that this made it so that there was stronger interconnectedness within the country - which later explains why so many areas of england was in revolt within the same year - really short intervals... some have even suggested that this rapid spread of the revolt suggests a conspiracy of sorts. However, it could also showcas that which the literature on world systems theory did for the world's intercommunicational network as a whole: that the lines were much shorter and frequent than we presume. Also, urbainzation made it so that it was at the root of a strong divided elite 

_14th century in general_ 
A selection of some of the things that happened in the 14th century showing it was a somewhat sad period. 
the prosperity of the 13th cent was off-set by the hardships in the 14th. 
- ice age 
- great famine of 1315-17 pinnacled the end of the medieval warm period https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Warm_Period
- black death 1347-1351 - around the 1350s 
- epidemics such as the typhoid epidemic of 1318 - which could spread more easily becauase of the posterior urbanization in the 13th century. 
- Schism of 1378: a break within the roman catholic church. (bear in mind that protestantism didnt exist back then)
- monghol invasions
- hundred years war commenced in 1337 
- banking crisis in italy in the early 14th century https://www.britannica.com/topic/Peruzzi-family
- the vastly increased cost and devastating effects of larger-scale ware (in the realm of naval warfare as well as with technological advancements )
