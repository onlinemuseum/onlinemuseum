<!-- 
reinland - rimland theory 
The gate to Asia through Europe? - how does it fulfill that role in practice? 
The gate to the black sea - with the sevastopol harbor this is even more important... then what is the important of the black sea? 
Some general geopoltiics: why do country's positions even matter in the global economy? 

_the country is stirring up_ making it more interesting for foreign governments. 
Internal politics: gullinists vs. x
The lira problems: as the economist said in the podcast. Turkey is not that strong economically. BUt geographically, it is VÉRY important. -> this makes it prone to foreign interest in it (and this has been true: they had a deal with russia for the purchase of balistic weapons.)

energy supply security 

_arguments_ 
energy security has undoubtedly become important (Mohapatra, 2016).
Barry Buzan and George Lawson argue that natural resources was described as an evolution in the internatoinal system 
J. Nye also said that “resource bargaining” played an important role, stressing the role of shaping energy supply in the regoins 
As a result, both European countries ‘ energy supply security has been damaged and their costs have increased and they have experienced an economic break (Yilmaz& Kalkan, 2017). 
By the 1990s, due to the collapse of the USSR, neoliberalism had declared its victory and globalization had begun to spread around the world. Thus, the concept of “interdependence” introduced by liberalism began to manifest itself, and at the point of energy security, it evolved towards cooperation rather than the power-oriented strategy of the Cold War (Furuncu& Akbaş, 2019b).  

<!-- fun fact 
Geopolitics includes a country’s population, climate, physical characteristics, and natural resources. Country policies and strategies are determined by taking these elements into account (Harunoğulları, 2020: 181).
The concept of geopolitics was first used among military concepts. But then the discipline of international relations also began to conduct geopolitical analyses, better seeing the interactions in the geographical area and producing a better policy for the future (Sevim, 2012: 4379). -->

_own note_
the black sea geopgraphical importance / sevastopol is to have a foothold on the suez canal. This is truly of global importance. The suez canal is the centre of interest / central point i fwar were to arise. 
Same with the importance of Israel and Yemen (where few know that the USA was highly involved in ... and many countries in fact=)
-> is turkey also important from ME / saudi oil? -> try to figure if pipelines go through it.
