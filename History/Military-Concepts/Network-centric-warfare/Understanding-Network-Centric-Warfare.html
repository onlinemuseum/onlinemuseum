<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>&ensp;&ensp; If you are a mere ‘civilian’ like me, you may not have heard about Network-Centric Warfare (NCW). Still, it is a core principle in modern armed forces.
<p>&ensp;&ensp; Given its ever-increasing presence in warfare today, I think we shóuld know about Net-Centric Warfare. 
  That is why I wrote this article: to introduce you to thisconcept and to go into some of its related challenges.
  <h2>Definition</h2>
  <p>&ensp;&ensp;Let me start with a definition <a href="https://www.hsdl.org/?abstract&did=446193">provided</a> by the United States’ homeland security library:
    <p id="Quote3"> 
      The term “network-centric warfare” broadly describes the combination of emerging tactics, techniques, and procedures that a fully or even partially networked force can employ to create a decisive warfighting advantage.
      </p>
    <h2>Emergence</h2>
  <p>&ensp;&ensp;   In the 1990s, analysts started to realise that information was becoming more central to warfare than it had ever been before. A force’s ability to aggregate, analyse and act on information was to become vital to its effective operation.
      <p>&ensp;&ensp;   In the preface of <i>Network-Centric Warfare : Its Origin and Future</i>, Vice Admiral A.K. Cebrowski and high-ranking Department of Defence member J.J. Garstka <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=Network-Centric+Warfare%3A+Its+Origin+and+Future+by+Arun+Pushkar&btnG=">reflected on Network-Centric Warfare as such</a>:
     <p id="Quote3">We are in the midst of a revolution in military affairs (RMA) unlike any seen since the Napoleonic Age, when France transformed warfare with the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lev%C3%A9e_en_masse">levée en masse</a>.</p>

<h2>NCW in practice</h2>
        <p>&ensp;&ensp;    Having introduced the concept of Network-Centric Warfare and provided a brief backdrop to its emergence, let us try to grasp what NCW means in practical terms.
<p>&ensp;&ensp;Well, theoretically speaking, there are innumerable ways of understanding NCW. But, in general terms it is a desire to optimize the inter-operability and inter-communication between two or more distinct parts of the army.
  <p>&ensp;&ensp;Let me — within the limits of my outsider understanding of armed forces — provide an example which shows one way of understanding NCW:
<ul>
  <li>Step #1: satellites (SATINT), humans (HUMINT) and other battlefield sensors aggregates information</li>
  <li>Step #2: a command and control centre analyses this information, turns it into ‘situational awareness’, creates ‘knowledge’ (making meaning of raw data) and, finally, directs a strike</li>
  <li>Step #3: an F-35 uses the amassed information and data to conduct a directed, precise airstrike</li>
</ul>
<h2>Different manifestations</h2>
<p>&ensp;&ensp; ‘NCW’ and ‘system of systems’ are rather vague concepts and should be seen as a front door to a humongous corpus of literature and debates.
  <p>&ensp;&ensp; For instance, there are more specific terms such as <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4086617">net-centric conversation (NCC)</a> and there are varying efforts to improving NCW, such as moving towards a <a href="https://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/pdf/03_0948.pdf">more esperanto-like, universal language</a> in military communication.
    <p>&ensp;&ensp; If you are interested in reading about such suggested implementations NCW, there are plenty of (declassified) documents to be found on the internet.

<h2>Challenges</h2>
<p>&ensp;&ensp;Naturally, there are a lot of challenges, disruptions and risks that relate to a System of Systems. Some of them are as follows
<ul>
<li>Mission Creep: the ongoing Ukraine invasion shows that an elongated war makes operations, morale, a sense of direction and communications much more difficult to maintain.</li>
<li> Far from home versus ‘Interior Lines’ theory: The Seven Years War illustrates how a strong aspect of home-core advantage is having short logistical lines. Military historians have suggested that this was a remarkable asset of Frederick The Great’s army during this war.</li>
<li>(Communication) disruption and misdirection: these principles are ancient if not natural. Sun Tzu wrote about this in The Art of War.</li>
<li>Fog of War: you cannot know everything and, thus, there will always be unforeseen variables hindering operations. These variables can be caused from within. For instance, the Battle of Mogadishu illustrates a seemingly vast under-estimation of public resistance. In addition, a lot of unforeseen events <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ApfDyeP7Zk">occurred</a> during this mission and the mission got really ugly really fast.
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>&ensp;&ensp;Hopefully, I was able to provide you with a general understanding of Network-Centric Warfare. Again, I am a mere ‘member of the public’ and so this article will undoubtedly be incomplete.
<p>&ensp;&ensp;However, I did my due diligence by reading plenty of material and, as such, I hope to have given you some valuable insights.
