    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>&ensp;&ensp;Hokkaido is a large island that's part of Japan. 
        It is the northermost 'main island' of Japan and is best known for its high amounts of nature. 
        <br><br>
        The climate is much different from other parts of Japan.
        The winters are much colder but the summers are quite smooth. 
        Let us go over some cultural & geographical elements of Hokkaido. 
        
    <h2>Inhabitants</h2>
    <p>&ensp;&ensp;
        Hokkaido stretches 80.000 square kilometers and is very low in population density. The largest city is Sapporo, counting almost 2 million inhabitants. But, that's already a third of Hokkaido's 6 million residents.
        <br><br>
        The native people of Hokkaido is just a small portion of today's population: they are the Ainu (and they are the native population in all of Japan).

    <h2>Nature</h2>
        <p>&ensp;&ensp;
            Hokkaido is best known for its vast nature. 
            Humongous forests stretch over the island, and sometimes travellers even get lost. 
            <p>&ensp;&ensp;
            Given Hokkaido's northerly location, the Japanese love to go there on summer holidays. It reliefs them from the hot summers in more southern parts of the country.
    <p>&ensp;&ensp;
        Sadly, some people do not realize how wild Hokkaido can be. That's why bear attacks have formed quite a problem in the region. Luckily, prevention measures have minimized the number of fatal bear encounters in more recent years.

    <p id="PicCaption">Sobetsu Falls: an example of Hokkaido's beautiful nature. There is a multitude of sights like this one in the proximity of Sapporo, capital of Hokkaido (you need not travel far).</p>
    <p>&ensp;&ensp;
        There are some unique & beautiful natural sights in Hokkaido... And frankly, there are too many to sum them up in this article. Feel blessed to stumble upon such a site, or discover one in a beautiful book designated to Hokkaido. 
    <p>&ensp;&ensp;
        If I could name one natural sight though, it would be Otowa Bridge. I dream of going there one day, since it is a common sighting spot for red-crowned cranes.
        
    <h2>Culture</h2>
    <p>&ensp;&ensp;So, we have learned that Hokkaido is distinct from other parts of Japan in terms of nature. However, this goes for culture too. 
    <p>&ensp;&ensp;To name just one example, Hokkaido has some unique festivals. The <a href="https://www.snowfes.com/english/">Sapporo Snow Festival</a> is a big deal for people in- and outside of Hokkaido. It hosts some beautiful ice sculptures & light shows. 
    <p>&ensp;&ensp;There are some culturally unique sights too, and some of them even have fascinating stories to them.
    <p>&ensp;&ensp;Take the town Shizunai. It lies in the south of Hokkaido and was once founded by an exiled Samurai. Apart from that, the town is known for its cherry blossom avenue. It's a testimony that you could discover many unexpected and fun things on a journey to Hokkaido.
