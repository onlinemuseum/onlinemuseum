                            The atom bomb is one of the hallmarks of the Cold War. The destructive potential of these bombs made the stakes of war so high that making the 'cold war' hot would have unimaginable results.

                            Shortly after the Second World War tensions between the USSR and 'the West' grew high.

                            In 1962, the USA found out that the USSR had installed atomic missile launch platforms in Cuba. 
                            <br><br>
                            The USA were alarmed by the thought of having missiles 'in their backyard'. That's why they blockaded all USSR's naval traffick to Cuba: they disabled them from arming the platforms with actual missiles. 
                            <br><br>
                            The USSR's forceful advance through USA's naval blockade was called off at the last moment. But, the tensions were tremendously high during this event. That's why it's called The Cuban Missile crisis.

                            Human intelligence was at an all-time-high during the Cold War. That's why so many spy films and books (think James Bond and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy) were made during the cold war.

                            The USA' active Cold War policy was 'Containment': they wanted to prevent their allied nations from falling to Communism. They strongly feared public revolts that could overturn their nation's governments and make it Communist. 
                            <br><br>
                            'Containing' the sphere of USA's influence was of paramount importance, as every fallen nation could instill a 'Domino effect' of more countries following suit. 
                            <br><br>
                            The Bay of Pigs in Cuba incident relates to the USA's active approach in the internal politics of nations all across the world. Cuban rebel leader Che Guevara (above) was one of the USA's most notable public enemy in the Cold War.

                            Vietnam is another example of USA's containment policy. When you think of the Cold War, the Vietnam War might be the first thing that pops into your mind. 
                            <br><br>
                            In America, public opinion about the Vietnam grew steadily more negative. While Vietnam veterans were not warmly welcomed by the American public at their return, their war-time stories gained massive interests in a couple of years after the conflict. 
                            <br><br>
                            Many classic films such as Forest Gump and Apocalypse now delve into the psychology of the individual soldier, which is one of the hallmarks of New Military history (instead of documenting massive open battles, the personal experience became more important).
