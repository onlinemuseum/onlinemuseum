<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>&ensp;&ensp;When World War II was coming to an end, tensions between the allied countries arose. Some consider the starting point of the Cold War to be 1947 (like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War">Wikipedia states</a>), but the tensions truly date back to / originate in 1944-5. Here is a hand full of evidence for the argument that the Cold War began before 1947. 
</p>

<h2>The Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact</h2>
The USSR and Germany secretly agreed to invade and split up Poland into respective spheres of influence. With this pact, USSR betrayed its agreements and oral statements of support toward the Allied powers. When the USSR was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Barbarossa">attacked by Germany </a>in 1941 it joined the Allied forces. 

<p>&ensp;&ensp;But, it goes without saying that their earlier actions and their cultural differences spurred internal turmoil between all the allied parties. This turmoil was amplified by Russia’s retreat from World War I in 1917 - albeit softer, the Allies saw this as a form of betrayal too. 
</p>
<p id="SideStory2">The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact has many alternative names, such as the Hitler-Stalin Pact and the Devil's Alliance. </p>
<h2>D-Day</h2>
<p>&ensp;&ensp;
Because of Russia’s betrayal and fear regarding the post-war situation, it was important for the Allies that they had a noticeable, ‘set-in-stone’ contribution to the war too. That’s why D-Day and the recapture of Europe was - probably - accelerated to a year earlier than planned. The Russians had advanced so rapidly on the Eastern front, that the Allies may have felt compelled to act too - in a similarly big manner. </p>

<h2>Operation Market Garden</h2>
<p>&ensp;&ensp;Soon after D-Day followed Operation Market Garden; it was all about speeding up the Western advance into Germany (and ultimately Berlin). While fighting the same enemy, the USSR and the West were themselves in a competition to be first to reach the German capital Berlin.  </p>
</b>
<p id="SideStory2">Eisenhower talked about his hope of reaching Berlin: “...  would be adequate to get one thrust to Berlin".</p>

    <img src="BridgeTooFarFilm.jpg" alt="still from the film a Bridge too far ">
    <p id=”PicCaption”>Still from the ‘A Bridge Too Far’ film. The Arnhem (Netherlands) bridge marked the failure of Market Garden, and disabled the allied from advancing into Germany (and Berlin) over the coming winter. </p>
<h2>Lend-Lease</h2>
<p>&ensp;&ensp;The USA’s exact intentions are not documented, but it seems that another way in which the allies wanted to expand their contribution to the avances against Germany is their Russian Lend-lease program± they practically donated material like planes and (harley davidson) motorcycles to the USSR. (a way that the USA wanted to take part of the credit for Eastern advances)


<p>&ensp;&ensp;During World War 2, the USA wanted to be seen as the big saviours of Europe. That’s why they lended / leased war material (like motorcycles and airplanes) to Allied nations. It could be that the lend-lease program for Russia (who was in desperate need for good materials and - especially - airplanes at the time) was not only geared against the Allies’ common enemy, but also a diplomatic play to show that the USA was involved in the East front too; it is thinkable that the USA wanted to be seen as ‘the ones who helped the USSR when it was in dire need for aid’. </p>

<h2>War-time Diplomacy </h2>
<p>&ensp;&ensp;
    War-time Conferences and intra-Allied Diplomacy testify to internal politics (french exclusion means internal politics between the Allies) </p>
<ul>
    <li>Memos and contracts such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentages_agreement">Percentages Agreement</a> show that Allied forces were already occupied with post-war spheres of influence when World War II was still raging. </li>
    <li>The diplomatic process of creating Israel in the Middle East is another  example of geopolitics is the creation of Israel (palestinians did not want it and the British had fought for this). It is another example of how war-time diplomatics resulted into heated conflicts in the post-war era. In this case it relates to <a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Eastern_Cold_War “>’The Middle Eastern Cold War’</a></li>
    <li>Conferences involving the ‘Big Three’ (USA, USSR, GB) showcase that much had to be discussed about post-war spheres of influence (besides Allied advances). These conferences were in Tehran, <a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yalta_Conference”>Yalta</a>, Potsdam conference in moscow.</li>
    <li>At <a href=”https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/truman-drops-hint-to-stalin-about-a-terrible-new-weapon “>one of these conferences</a> Truman hinted Stalin at his ownership of atom bombs. 
    </li>

</ul>
his ownership of atom bombs. 
<p id=’SideStory’>The USSR developed its first atomic bomb in 1949 under codename ‘first lightning’ - it is something war-time Germans had hoped to create.</p>

<h2>Expansionism</h2>
<p>&ensp;&ensp;Before and during the Great War, Russia’s expansionist inclinations became apparent - and they were naturally met with Western aversion. 
    <ul>
        <li>Military aid in afghan civil war in 1930</li>
        <li>Winter war against Finland in 1939 (enabled by the Hitler-Stalin Pact). A typical example that Stalin wanted to expand russia’s sphere of influence</a></li>
        <li>Occupation of Poland and the Baltic states(With germany) </li>
        <li>Conquest on Romania in the summer of 1940. 
        </li>
    
    </ul></p>
    <p>&ensp;&ensp;As mentioned before, the USA wanted to be seen as ‘the global liberator’ and freedom fighter. That’s why they publicly stressed post-war decolonization - but in a similar fashion, they denounced the USSR’s expansionist tendencies.</p>
    <p id=’SideStory’>The end of World War Two was called <a href=”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stunde_Null”>‘Stunde Null’</a> (Hour Zero) because the world had to rebuild itself and the political climate had to be reshapen.
    </p>
    
<h2>Bombing of Japan </h2>
<p>&ensp;&ensp;USA’s bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima was probably unnecessary towards the eventual Japanese defeat. But given the USSR’s rapid advance in Manchuria and imminent conquest on Japan’s main islands, the exact motive behind the Atom bomb becomes dubious. <br><br>&ensp;&ensp; Quite some historians theorize that USA couldn’t afford USSR to reach Tokyo before they did: the Russians had already beat them to Berlin and the US still lacked public retaliation against Japan’s Pearl Harbor attack.  <br><br>&ensp;&ensp; Perhaps the Atomic bombs were a mere power play to end the Pacific War in dominant fashion - but that argument seems to shallow by nature. We could add the exhausting process of capturing tiny strategic islands off of Japan’s coast, the lack of reaction from smaller bombings on Japan, the negative public opinion about high American casualties and losses and a similar public backlash over Kamikaze attacks - but still the argument for throwing atom bombs may still be insufficient. <br><br>&ensp;&ensp; The reason for throwing the two atom bombs (resulting in circa 200.000 casualties) are still debated, but it seems rather apparent that - in one way or the other - this bombing relates to the ideological and cultural battle between USA and USSR - to be the liberator of the world and to dominate their cultural spheres as a caring, but merciless-if-provoked father.
