<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h2>Intrinsic Value</h2>
<p>&ensp;&ensp;The English writer Samuel Johnson (1709-1784) said: "Praise, like gold and diamonds, owes its value only to its scarcity". 
However, is it true that gold is merely a belief system, or does it have intrinsic, ever-potent value?
<h2></h2>
<p>&ensp;&ensp;
Gold has been admired by civilizations for many ages. 
The properties, aesthetics and surrounding mystery have recurringly appealed to people across time and space. 
This long validation-record supports the notion that gold will intrinsically never lose demand.
It is this track-record of age-old demand that make gold a preferred method of wealth insurance .
Traders such as Robert Kiyosaki apply this notion to their personal gold 'reserves'.
It not only covers potential national financial collapse, but also insures people monetarily against threats to their personal agency. 
Robert Kiyosaki holds gold because, if all else failes, he can still rely on his gold to be valuable and liquid.
<p>&ensp;&ensp;
Independent people are not the only ones who extend their financials with real bars of gold, but banks and even nations do it too. 
Circa 200.000 tonnes of gold have been mined in the world, and a lot of it resides motionless in huge vaults.
Such huge reserves reiterate that today's currencies are merely a representation of goods (and services). 
Every member of the financial system should probably acknowledge that the signifiers of money (bank statements, cash money) hold next to no value. 
The things which you can buy with money and the hope for future revenue are among the most notable assets that underpin your wealth measured in currency.

<p>&ensp;&ensp;
In crises and historic cases of hyper-inflation, we have noticed how volatile currency can be. 
A recurring issue in such cases, is that people lose their faith in the currency, and a snowball effect occurs.
They rather place their trust in other goods and services, than in currency. 
That's exactly why gold is such a great means of wealth insurance; the good with a millenia-old tradition and predates Ã¡ll currencies on earth.
Gold may be a mere believe system that bases itself on that tradition. 
Indeed, even if gold had no intrinsic appeal at all, gold could be a self-fulfilling prophecy in times of crisis; people know it as safe-haven and trust gold to remain desirable.

They may prefer to hold onto gold. 
Whether gold has intrinsic appeal or not, it is a blief belief system - at least in part - too. 
However, the
They rather hold gold, other currencies and the capacity to produce.
While those alternative things 
Money is based on a shared belief of its worth. 
Once fear makes its way into the minds of the masses, the snowball effect is hard to reverse

<p>&ensp;&ensp;
Some poeple have indeed acknowledged that products, services and goods lie at the center of - not purely the economy, but also - personal wealth itself. 
Realizing this 'favor-centric' mechanism makes people go into the stock market and explains why they buy real gold. 

Currency can be printed, manipulated or suffer from nigh uncontrollable causes and 'fear of missing out' with regard to said currency.
Indeed, cases of hyper-inflation such as Venezuela (2016) and the Weimar Republic (1922) prove that currency has the potential to change drastically, and is thus rather variable.
The food industry, control over housing, power and the (partial) ownership of many sorts of production have proven much more stable than currency in such cases of hyper-inflation. 
These extremes simply prove that "Money" does not make "the world go round" but access to security, resources and services do.  
<p>&ensp;&ensp;
Given this resource-and-favor-centric underpinning of the financial system you may wonder why we ever abondoned the gold standard. 
You may for instance ask: Isn't gold one of the most strongly validated resources that has some intrinsic value? 
There are strong arguments against the gold standard, and most economists seem to agree that the abolishment of this standard has been positive for worldwide welfare. 
However, people such as Robert Kiyosaki and even governments themselves realize that one probably still should seize some of the advantages of owning assets with a 'competitive long-term advantage' or a strong track-record of stability.
That is to say, stocks, reserves, goods, services and suchlike things do not merely form the foundation of the monetary sysstem, they may also provide a safe-haven in case currency failes.
The above explains why gold is a popular form of wealth insurance, but the angle of this article should not take away from the potential of other such insurance measures.
<p>&ensp;&ensp;
I like to call this article an exhibition of weatlh insurance. 
The angle of this article has been gold reserves, but its purpose is to indicate the basics of economy and the necessity to be - at times - able to detach currency from wealth. 
This showcase of wealth insurance and the basic workings of economy is perhaps rudimentary to understanding (modern) history and the way that the world works today.
It is not a pure gallery of historical documents, but I hope it provides somewhat of an insight in the basics of economy and helps you to define and come to your personal terms with money. 

It is not a pure museum gallery, but does concern an attempt to improve your understanding of the workings 


This can be a strongly validated resource, such as gold. 
Or it could be stocks 


- while its demand will always remain (most likely), gold itself is more variable in terms of price 
- you can't loan out gold or even have the current situation 7x debt over the world

<p>&ensp;&ensp;The concept of 'Kairos' has seeped into other disciplines too. Rhetoricians have used the notion quite intensively in their theorizing on the delivery of a speech. These heuretic thinkers realized that speeches, sentences and content should - and always do - stand in relation to 'Kairos'. The reason why 'I have a Dream' has become such a popular speech is not merely due to its content, but also because of its 'right timing'. It pinnacled a long period of social unrest and protests that was present on a nation-wide level.
<p>&ensp;&ensp;Another interesting elaboration on the theory of 'Kairos' is Quantum physics. It considers the question of multiple realities. One well-known element of Quantum physics is its notion that observation changes outcome: scientists noticed that the placement of a camera changed the outcome of a repetitive experiment drastically. If observation is included in the equasion of 'Kairos', then our earlier example is refuted: if we did not see the shooting star because we looked the otherway, it remains the question whether that shooting star actually existed and if we would have seen it if we did look the right way.

<p id="PicCaption">In order to philosophise about Kairos we must also consider the question 'what is reality' </p>
<p>&ensp;&ensp;You may feel that the concept of 'right time' (Kairos) and time itself have been appropriated strongly in modern times, and that it has now become incredibly hard to understand. We can learn from the essential philosophy that the Ancient Greeks have brought us, and be excited to seek understanding of Quantum physics theory, and for any future revelations.
