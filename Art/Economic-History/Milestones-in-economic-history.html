                            <br>
                              To pinpoint the first use of currency is difficult for <u>two reasons</u>: 
                              <br><br>
                              <span style="color:rgb(8, 75, 8);">A).</span> The archaeological record suffers from 'survivor bias', and does not guarantee our notions about the starting-point for currency.
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              <span style="color:rgb(6, 66, 6);">B).</span> It depends on the way in which currency is defined. Yuval N. Harari argues for "an intersubjective (existing only in the collective human mind) belief that is called money". 
                              That is to say, we could suggest that anything with underlying value that is exchanged should be called 'money'. 
                              This would mean that trading grain for a clay pot denotes the exchange between two forms of currency.

                            <br>
                              Perhaps a decent working theory to defining currency is that it is the (somewhat standardized) tokenization of something of value. 
                              This definition is a popular way of thinking about money among historians and archaeologists.
                              <br><br>
                              When it comes to the archeaological record, a common notion is that the first form of currency emerged in Mesopotamia. 
                              People were able to exchange goods such as grain in central depots for tokens made of clay. 
                              These clay tokens then marked a particular value that could be exchanged for a small number of other local services, goods and responsibilities.

                            <br>
                              As societies grew more complex and wished to trade outside of their communities, mere administrative markers such as clay tokens did not suffice. 
                              That's one of the reasons why coins (with the use of somewhat scarce metals) were minted. 
                              But it is also the reason why other forms of currency were used: 
                              <br><br>
                              The Romans are believed to have paid soldiers in salt - forming the etymological foundation of the word 'salary'. 
                              This present-day word comes from the latin term salarium, with sal meaning salt. 
                              There is doubt about the historic accuracy of this form of payment, but Roman authors such as Pliny form some support for this phenomenon.
                              <br><br>
                              The Aztec empire was quite an advanced society; they could sustain rather large cities with complex economies. 
                              Standardized currency formed a foundation for their intricate economies. 
                              They had several markers of value, but cacao beans were at the top of this currency scale. 
                              The Aztecs believed cacao was a gift from the gods, and reserved chocolate, chocalate milk and other products for the highest classes in society.
                              Their high valuation of cacao goes to show that scarcity combined with belief drives up value. 
                              It is such an essential mechanism that has recurred in Economic History for as long as we can remember.
                              In today's terms, we might call it 'fear of missing out', but perhaps it has more to do with human physiology or the essence of nature itself.

                            As trade become less local, there was more need for transmutable currency.
                            For instance, with the rise of the Roman empire, a dependable currency was important for administrative purposes, practical reasons and cohesion. 
                            Because the Roman coin was used across its empire, governors were able to report and collect taxes. 
                            Indeed, it is hard to think of a Roman empire without the presence of coin in it; how else could they sustain an intricate economy and administration across the

                            <br><br>
                            Such widespread use of the same coin required a 'standardization' of money; coins should be as close to pure duplicates of one another as possible.

                            This process of standardizing money went on for many ages, and across multiple empires and civilizations. 
                            A recurring issue that needed solving is fraud.
                            Complicated craftsmanship and other methods were an effort to hinder the production of counterfeit money. 
                            Technological advancements obstructed other forms of fraud: ribbles on the side of coins were invented so that people could not unnoticeably scrape of the sides of coins (made of valuable materials).
                            <br><br>
                            The digitzation of currency is a quite modern technological advancement of money.
                            It may inhibit fraud and even some forms of crime as it facilitates the tracking of money streams and analysis of the plausibility of earnings.

                            J.M.W. Turner painted at a time that Great Britain was industrializing. Trains such as the one deicted on this image became one of the hallmarks of this rapidlly mechanizing world. 
                            <br><br>Turner is praised for giving the spectators of his paintings the impression that the subject is moving; whether it be a boat in rough waters or this speeding train, Turner was a master in creating this mirage.

                            <br>
                            Another way in which Turner portrayed a mark of the time on his canvas is depiction of this slave ship. It shows the agony of those (alive and dead) who were thrown overboard and triggers onlookers to question the morality of slavetrade. You are welcome to <i>click on the image to observe it in a new tab</i>.
                            <br><br>
                            It coincided with a contemporary societal debate in Great Britain; people were looking back on a shameful period of slavetrading. The gruesome events that occured on the slave ship 'Zong' inspired Turner to make this painting.

According to myth, Dido <a href="https://www.civilopedia.net/en-US/gathering-storm/civilizations/leader_dido">laid out a circle of cow hides</a> to signify the expanse of the city before it came to be.
                            <br><br>
                            Turner's incorporation of classic architecture hints towards his lifelong interest in the portrayal of architectural works.

                          <p><i>The Decline of the Carthaginian Empire (1817)</i> <br>   <br>
                            If you compare this painting to the previous one, you may notice that it incorporates much darker areas and hues. That is because the earlier painting portrays the birth of Carthage, and this one portrays its decline. 
                            <br><br>
                            The setting sun casts long shadows, and the dark area in the bottom right seems to be expanding and making its literal dark mark on the city; it is making its way from the sea onto the land and devoids all that is on its path from light (<i>click on the image to expand it in a new tab</i>).
                            <br><br>
                            I like to think that this destructive shadow that slowly devours the city exemplifies the destructive power from the sea yet again. We have seen how turner portrayed the water's immense strength in many of his paintings. Perhaps it could (partly) explain why this dark Carthaginian leper comes from the sea then. Alternatively, it could hint towards other maritime powers that overthrow Carthage's prowess by means of their maritime strength (think of Rome). <b>(End of Gallery)</b>
