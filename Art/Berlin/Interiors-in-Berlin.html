                            Among European metropolis, Berlin is probably the one with the most interesting recent history of the past 100 years. This results in the city being extremely miscellaneous in terms of architecture and thus - a very convenient shooting location. In the beautifully shot Netflix’ series ‘The Queen’s Gambit’, Berlin successfully starred as Moscow, Paris, several US cities incl. Las Vegas - and even as New Mexico!  
                            <br><br>

                            This inspired us to take a closer look at Berlin 20th century interiors, which - although in non-Corona times publicly accessible, remain mostly unnoticed, even by the locals. 
                            <br><br>
                            
                            Despite the unusual history and two very different political ideological approaches being represented in the city throughout the most of the 20th century, examples of impressive mid-century modernist interiors could found on both sides of the Berlin Wall. 
                            <br><br>
                            
                            Some of the buildings presented here were designed and built from scratch, showing different faces of broadly understood modernism. Others were partly reconstructed in their historical forms, but given interiors, which quite surprisingly for East Berlin and inconsistent as social realism was, referred to bourgeois traditions.

                            The entrance hall of IG Metall Berlin is probably one of the most beautiful interiors of pre-war modernism in Berlin and also a precursory one. The same solutions, like winding flights of stairs, huge windows and sophisticated while simple railings will be present in interior design - and considered ‘modern’ - up to 30 years later.

                        The building of Volksbühne was damaged during the war to a large extent. During the restoration, which took place in the 50s, it was decided to go with bourgeois details like spectacular chandeliers, even though one could think, the ‘People’s Theatre’ in East Berlin would be a place where any bourgeois association should be avoided at all costs :)

                          Sponsored by the US, the congress hall of West Berlin, is one of the most anecdotal buildings in the city. It it not only called “the pregnant oyster” or “Jimmy Carter’s smile” - it also collapsed in 1980. This event is often being associated with the name of the German punk band Einstürzende Neubauten - even though the band named themselves so just several week before.
                          Rebuilt in 1987, it is in full use today, though the interior details lost some of the original 50s charm.

                          The French cultural centre - still in use! - is located in the north of the city in the former French sector of Berlin. Its almost fully glazed facade generously lets the light in and the dominant stairs with horizontal brass railings resemble the hall of IG Metall.

                          The building and its furnishing are very well preserved, giving a good idea also about some less spectacular interior elements of the 50s, such as radiators, floor tiles or the ceiling cladding.

                          Kino International is located in the most representative avenue of East Berlin (former Stalin Allee!) and used to be its flagship cinema. The projection hall had a special row of seats - the 8th one! - reserved for members of the communist party, with the optimal view at the screen and extra leg freedom. After premiers, celebrations continued in a party room, today known as ‘Honecker’s lounge’. In the cellars, an anecdote says, there used to be a small atom bunker - for the high communist officials.

                          The structure of the building is well proportioned, light and classy. There is a number of creative aesthetic solutions applied in the interior design, which are still well preserved, like a variety of wall, ceiling and floor claddings. Also the original lamps, benches and chairs are worth the attention.

                          If you take a closer look at the sad and boring hotel restaurant, where Beth Harmon is having her breakfast when in Moscow, you’ll recognize the accordingly styled bar area of Kino International! Even though the wooden panelling and the Czekoslovakian glass chandeliers dominate the space, in real it is very cheerful - and the famous Berlin TV tower can be seen through its huge windows.

                          The congress hall of East Berlin was built as part of a complex housing an administrative center for teachers. It is a very well proportioned square pavilion, literally built of steel and glass, with a round auditorium crowned by a dome.

                          Berlin Philharmonie is probably the most famous project by Hans Scharoun and one of Berlin’s architectural icons. The foyer is dynamic, multi-facetted, mixing various materials and combining rough elements with some delicate, sensual ones.

                          Kronprinzenpalais is an example of a post-war reconstruction, where the outside imitates the original but the interior is kept contemporary - in this case it is an expression of nostalgia for Viennese art nouveau and art deco, again - quite against the official ideology.

                          It was designed by the famous couple of Czech architects (Věra & Vladimir Machonin ) and its unique status is very much cherished - the Czech Cultural Centre hosts numerous events on 20th century architecture.

                          The building is still in a good shape and serves its original purpose - not only the lighting of the auditorium, mosaics and furniture, but even plastic “elephant” hooks in the bathroom survived till our times.

                          Friedrichstadtpalast is a building that could well have been built somewhere and somewhen else than East Berlin in the 80s. With its stained glass windows, characteristic chandeliers and metal work, it actually refers in to art nouveau and art deco.

                          If you look closely, you will recognise that Friedrichstadtpalast “starred” in Netflix’ Queen’s Gambit! It was the luxurious hotel in New Mexico, where one of the chess tournaments took place - and everyone took it for credible 60s :)

                          Tempelhof Airport is maybe not a flagship example of ‘modern’ interior design - still, with airports being continuously modernized, it is hard to find one which got so stuck in the 20th century that it was turned into a museum :)
