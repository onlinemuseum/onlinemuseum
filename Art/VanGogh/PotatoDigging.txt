Potato Digging
Vincent Van Gogh enjoyed painting the poor. 
Like in his other painting 'The Potato Eaters', it seems that the potato symbolizes the subjects' social standing. 


The Potato Eaters
Nuenen, April 1885
Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam
Potatoes are a recurring subject in Van Gogh's works. 
This scene portrays living standards for poor people. 
Art-critics are particularly fond of the light dynamics in this scene.

Resides in the Van Gogh Museum.
Van Gogh made this painting after his father's death, and that's why the candles have stopped burning. 

Religion was an important aspect of Van Gogh's life. He did goodwill projects for the church and was an aspiring pastor for some time.
